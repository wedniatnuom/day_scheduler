# Day Scheduler

## Description

- Project Motivation: To build a responsive and reusable day schedule builder.

- Purpose: The project design was to build a daily planner that can help a busy employee manage thier time effectively.

- What did it solve: It help prevent forgetting about hourly tasks throughout a busy day.

- What I learned along the way: I learned how to save and get information from local storage. I also learned that "textarea" is a usuable field in html.

## Installation

Steps required to get off the ground: There is nothing required to run the program other than a web client and the file.

## Usage

How to use: Each hour can have text added manually into the Event section. Once you click on the check icon to the right it will be saved until you need to replace it. If you want to empty the field you can delete all info and click to save. This will give you a blank hour for the next day.

Future addtions: I would like to add a button that auto clear every field. This will make it easier to start each day from scratch.
